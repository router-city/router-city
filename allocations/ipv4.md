# IPv4 Addressing

router.city will utilize both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing within the network.

IPv4 addresses will be assigned from the `172.24.0.0/7` block, which is reserved for private network space. This range does not conflict with dn42, ChaosVPN, or Friefunk.

## Current IPv4 Allocations

| CIDR          | Range                      | User          |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 172.24.0.0/24 | 172.24.0.0 - 172.24.0.255  | [Famicoman](https://github.com/Famicoman)|
| 172.24.1.0/24 | 172.24.1.0 - 172.24.1.255  | [mikenabhan](https://github.com/mikenabhan)|

These ranges may be changed at any time if they are found to conflict with another range or be unusable for any reason.
