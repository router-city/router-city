# Autonomous System Numbers

Each organization on the router.city network with control of an address block will need a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) to identify the organization's network.

AS numbers will be assigned from the `64496 - 64511` range, which is reserved space for documentation and source code examples.

Please add your ASN in lexicographical order.

## Current ASN Allocations
