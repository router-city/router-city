# Autonomous System Numbers

Each organization on the router.city network with control of an address block will need a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) to identify the organization's network.

AS numbers will be assigned from the `64496 - 64510` range, which is reserved space for documentation and source code examples.

Please add your ASN in lexicographical order.

## Current ASN Allocations

| 64498 | [darkdrgn2k](https://github.com/darkdrgn2k)|
| 64499 | [brannondorsey](https://github.com/brannondorsey)|

This range may change at any time if it is found to conflict with another range or be unusable for any reason.
